                Im currently 18 yrs old, and i live in Dighton, MA. have a dog named Chandler. I named him after my favorite character from the show "Friends." I try to stay active,
                I go for runs every once-in-a-while, and I work out every other day. The temptations of laziness still haunt me. Sometimes i get out of bed and get dressed for a run,
                Then i walk out of my room and i see a beautiful couch with a TV infront of it just screaming my name.
