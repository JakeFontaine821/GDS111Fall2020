    <h2>My Bio</h2>
    <p>
        Im currently 18 yrs old, and i live in Dighton, MA. I have a dog named Chandler. I named him after my favorite character from the show "Friends." I try to stay active,
        I go for runs every once-in-a-while, and i work out everyday. However the temptations of laziness still haunt me. 
        Im a big league of legends player, i like the game a lot. Ive been playing the game for almost 6 years and i think ive gotten pretty good.
