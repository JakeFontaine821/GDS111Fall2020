        Im currently 18 yrs old, and i live in Dighton, MA. <i> have a dog named Chandler. I named him after my favorite character from the show "Friends."</i> I try to stay active,
        I go for runs every once-in-a-while, and I work out every other day. <em> the temptations of laziness still haunt me.</em> Sometimes i get out of bed and get dressed for a run,
        Then i walk out of my room and i see a beautiful couch with a TV infront of it just screaming my name.
